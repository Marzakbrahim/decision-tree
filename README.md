# decision-tree :
The objective is to predict the possibility of becoming a client if you wish to inquire at our firm.
To do this, I used the decision tree algorithm, I also used cross validation to choose the best 
parameters for my algorithm and finally I created a function that predicts the result if you enter the values of the features .
